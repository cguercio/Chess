# Pygame Chess

Welcome to Pygame Chess! This project is a fully functional chess game implemented in Python using the Pygame library.

## Purpose

This project serves as both a learning experience for me and a showcase piece for my portfolio. Through the development of Pygame Chess, I aim to deepen my understanding of Python programming, game development principles, and the complexities of chess logic. By including it in my portfolio, I can demonstrate my skills and expertise in these areas to potential employers or collaborators. Additionally, I encourage others to explore the project, experiment with its features, and contribute to its development, fostering a collaborative learning environment.

## Features

- Complete chess game implementation
- Graphical user interface using Pygame
- Support for all standard chess rules, including en passant, castling, and promotion
